Leapaint
========

A simple Java application that uses the Leap Motion Controller to draw lines in a window.

How do I use it?
=
This project was created using Eclipse.  Assuming you're using Eclipse already, all you have to do is download the project and import it into the Eclipse IDE.  

Everything is pre-configured to "just work", with the exception of LeapJava.jar, Leap.dll and LeapJava.dll.  These can not be redistributed via third parties; you can find these files within the Leap Motion SDK at https://developer.leapmotion.com/.  

The proper location for the DLLs is in the root directory of the project, while the .JAR can go anywhere you like so long as you remember to add it to your Java library path.
