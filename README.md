Leapaint
========

A simple Java application that uses the Leap Motion Controller to draw lines in a window.

This project was created using Eclipse, so you can simply download it and import it into your package browser and you'll
be good to go!

Note: You will need to link and place the appropriate LeapJava.jar, Leap.dll and LeapJava.dll files into the project, as these can not be redistributed via third parties.  You can find these files within the Leap Motion SDK at https://developer.leapmotion.com/.
